# What is an Agent? {background-color="black" background-image='images/locktonre-divider-slide.png' background-size="cover" background-position="center" footer=false}

## vs. LLMs and Workflows

- LLM: one-shot input/output
- Agent: **plans**, **uses tools**, **remembers**, **loops**
- Think → Act → Observe → Reflect

![agent-loop-diagram](images/agent-loop.png)

---

## Anatomy of an Agent

- **Planner**: decides next step
- **Tool use**: external APIs, Python, web search
- **Memory**: long-term recall
- **State**: tracks evolving context

## Example Agents

### Coding, Research, Reasoning

- GPT Researcher ^[[GPTResearcher.com](https://gptresearcher.com/)]
- Coding copilots 
- Manus.ai ^[[Manus.ai](https://manus.ai/)]
- LangGraph chains (multi-step workflows) ^[[LangGraph](https://langgraph.dev/)]

![agent-examples](images/examples.png)

## How Agents Work (LangGraph Example)

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages
from my_tools import analyze_triangle

workflow = StateGraph(state_type=dict)
workflow.add_node("analyze", analyze_triangle)
workflow.set_entry_point("analyze")
graph = workflow.compile()
graph.invoke({"triangle": triangle_data})
```

- Define nodes for tools, memory, reflection
- Add edges to define the loop

## Potential Benefits for Actuaries

- Faster workflows
- Tools + LLMs = better automation
- More transparency and judgment
- Memory for context across steps

# Actuarial Example: Reserving Agent {background-color="black" background-image='images/locktonre-divider-slide.png' background-size="cover" background-position="center" footer=false}

## Reserving Agent
- Uses Chainladder in Python
- Runs diagnostics
- Summarizes reserve indications
- Writes human-readable report

```python
def run_diagnostics(data):
    triangle = ChainladderTriangle(data)
    diagnostics = triangle.diagnostics()
    return diagnostics.summary()
```

---

## Build Your Own

- LangGraph is modular and open-source
- Colab notebooks provided
- Start with:
  - Planning
  - Tool execution
  - Output formatting

---

## Wrap-Up

- Agents = workflows + reasoning
- Use tools and memory to extend LLMs
- Actuaries can start experimenting today!
